# Quiz_Timer_Storage
On this program I implement time intervals, local storage and event liseners also with some jquery and bootstrap.
The code is not the cleanest but work as a quiz and able to save the scores of the players. It comes with a times that everytime you get the answer wrong it will decrease by 10 
the score is related to the timer so the higher the time higher the score.

#Criteria 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
